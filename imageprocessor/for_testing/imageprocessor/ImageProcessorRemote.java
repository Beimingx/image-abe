/**
 * The <code>ImageProcessorRemote</code> class provides a Java RMI-compliant interface to 
 * MATLAB functions. The interface is compiled from the following files:
 * <pre>
 *  D:\\dcpabe\\matlab-code\\keyGenrate.m
 *  D:\\dcpabe\\matlab-code\\LabelBox.m
 *  D:\\dcpabe\\matlab-code\\predict.m
 *  D:\\dcpabe\\matlab-code\\Reciver.m
 *  D:\\dcpabe\\matlab-code\\Sender.m
 * </pre>
 * The {@link #dispose} method <b>must</b> be called on a 
 * <code>ImageProcessorRemote</code> instance when it is no longer needed to ensure that 
 * native resources allocated by this class are properly freed, and the server-side proxy 
 * is unexported.  (Failure to call dispose may result in server-side threads not being 
 * properly shut down, which often appears as a hang.)  
 *
 * This interface is designed to be used together with 
 * <code>com.mathworks.toolbox.javabuilder.remoting.RemoteProxy</code> to automatically 
 * generate RMI server proxy objects for instances of imageprocessor.ImageProcessor.
